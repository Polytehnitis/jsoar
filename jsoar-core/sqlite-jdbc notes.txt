NOTICE:

The sqlite-jdbc has a backup and restore command each of which are intercepted by the driver.  This means
that you cannot prepare the statements like normal sql statements and there is a bit of a hack in
EpisodicMemoryDatabase.java and SemanticMemoryDatabase.java : backupDb to account for this.  There is also
some special handling in AbstractSoarDatabase to account for this as well.
